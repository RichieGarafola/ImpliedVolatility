# ImpliedVolatility
Implied volatility is the marketâ€™s expectations of volatility over the life of an option. To find implied volatility you need three things: the market price of the option, a pricing model, and a root finder. You can then find the volatility that sets the price from the model equal to the price of the market with the root finder.
